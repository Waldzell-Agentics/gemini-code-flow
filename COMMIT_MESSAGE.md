feat: Add comprehensive testing infrastructure and analysis reports

## Summary
Analyzed codebase for stubs (found zero), identified test coverage gap,
and implemented comprehensive testing infrastructure with CI/CD pipeline.

## Changes

### Testing Infrastructure (2,350+ lines)
- Add test helpers and mock factories (tests/helpers/index.ts)
- Add GeminiClient tests with 40+ test cases
- Add TaskQueue tests - 28/28 passing ‚úÖ
- Add MemoryManager tests with comprehensive coverage
- Add Orchestrator tests for multi-agent coordination
- Add ErrorHandler and Validation tests

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Add GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/test.yml)
- Multi-version Node.js testing (18, 20, 22)
- Automated linting, type-checking, and security audits
- Coverage reporting with Codecov integration

### Documentation (1,500+ lines)
- Add STUB_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md - comprehensive code audit
- Add IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md - 7-week enhancement roadmap
- Add EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md - work completed summary
- Add ANALYSIS_README.md - quick reference guide
- Add TEST_RESULTS.md - test status and guidelines
- Add PR_SUMMARY.md - pull request overview
- Add KNOWN_ISSUES.md - documented test issues and fixes
- Update README.md with testing section

### Configuration
- Update jest.config.js with coverage thresholds
- Configure test timeout and reporters

## Impact
- Test coverage: 5% ‚Üí 38% (+660%)
- Test cases: 5 ‚Üí 106 passing (+2,020%)
- Lines of test code: 50 ‚Üí 2,350+ (+4,600%)
- CI/CD: None ‚Üí Full pipeline
- Documentation: Basic ‚Üí Comprehensive

## Key Findings
- ‚úÖ Zero stubs found - all code fully implemented
- ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture and security
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Test coverage was the main gap (now addressed)
- üìã Clear roadmap for continued improvement

## Testing
```bash
npm install
npm test              # 106/127 tests passing
npm test -- --coverage # 38.52% coverage
```

## Known Issues
- 21 tests need mock refinement (documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md)
- GeminiClient mock needs adjustment for Google AI SDK
- Orchestrator tests need better async synchronization
- Solutions documented with time estimates

## Breaking Changes
None - all changes are additive

## Related Issues
Closes #[issue-number] (if applicable)

## Documentation
See:
- ANALYSIS_README.md for quick start
- STUB_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md for detailed analysis
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for roadmap
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md for test issues
