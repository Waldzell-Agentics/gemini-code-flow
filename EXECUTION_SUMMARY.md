## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - The codebase had zero stubs, not because there were none to find, but because the implementation was already excellent

2. **Security First**
   - Strong security practices throughout (path validation, input sanitization, rate limiting)

3. **Testing is Critical**
   - Even excellent code needs comprehensive tests
   - Tests document expected behavior
   - Tests enable confident refactoring

4. **Documentation Matters**
   - Good code + good tests + good docs = great project
   - Examples accelerate adoption

5. **Incremental Progress**
   - Started with critical components (core)
   - Will continue with commands and utils
   - Then integration and E2E
